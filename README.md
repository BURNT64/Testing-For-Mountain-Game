# 2023Assignment

Assignment Brief 

You are required to document and test your code from part 2 in a professional manner using Boost Test and Doxygen, in addition to writing exception handling code as appropriate. The precise details may depend on the level of ambition and style approach used in previous parts. It is advised that you separate classes into separate header and implementation files prior to carrying out this assessment if you have not done so already. Groups of functions with a common purpose should also be reorganised into their own header files. 

Testing 

You should implement unit tests for each method of each of the classes that you have built in addition to those provided by the prototype. In the event that you have not implemented additional classes or functions, this should be completed prior to testing. Your tests should include: 

At least one unit test for every method or function implemented (minimum 5 tests) (20%) 

At least one parameterised set of tests (10%) 

At least one randomised set of tests (10%) 

Documentation 

Once testing is complete you should document your code using Doxygen and produce html documentation outlining the purpose of every class and function along with its time complexity as well as any parameters, return types and template parameters involved. Documentation should include 

Purpose of each component (10%) 

All parameters defined (10%) 

All return types defined (10%) 

Time complexities identified (10%) 

Exception Handling 

You should create a custom exception to deal with incorrectly formatted data files. This exception should be successfully caught and the program should exit elegantly without crashing in all cases. Circumstances such as incorrect user input and absent files should not cause the program to crash either, although this may be achieved without the use of exceptions if preferred. 

Custom exception for incorrect file format (10%) 

Program exits elegantly without crashing no matter what fresh hell the marker throws at it (10%)
